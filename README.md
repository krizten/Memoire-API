## Technologies Used 👨‍💻

- ##### Server Application
  - [Node.js®](https://nodejs.org/en/), a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
  - [NestJS](https://nestjs.com), a progressive <a href="http://nodejs.org" target="blank">Node.js</a> framework for building efficient and scalable server-side applications.
  - [JSON Web Token (JWT)](https://jwt.io/) for token-based authenication.
  - [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), an open source object-relational database system.
  - [TypeORM](https://typeorm.io), an ORM that can run in NodeJS, Browser, Cordova, PhoneGap and Ionic platforms and can be used with TypeScript and JavaScript.
  - [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/), a scalable, high-speed, low cost, web-based service designed for backup and archiving of data.
- ##### Project Management
  - [Pivotal Tracker](https://pivotaltracker.com), agile project management tool of choice for developers, was used in managing this [project](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/2266427).
  - [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) & [Docker-Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/), a container technology, was applied to serve up the server application and database in separate but connected containers.
- ##### Testing
  - [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/), a complete API development environment, and flexibly integrates with the software development cycle for API testing.

## Installation 🏗️

- ##### Basic Installation

  - Install [Node.js®](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) on your host environment (or PC).
  - Create a Postgres database with the name: `memoiredb` or any appropriate name. Note the host, port, username and password of the database.
  - Ensure [Git](https://git-scm.com/) is installed, then clone this [repository](https://github.com/krizten/Memoire-API) by running `git clone https://github.com/krizten/Memoire-API.git` in the terminal.
  - Install the project dependencies by running `npm install`
  - Create a .ENV file, using the [.env.example](.env.example) as a sample fill all the fields with correct data.
  - Ensure the database service is running, then start the server application in development mode by running `npm run start:dev`
  - Use the [API documentation]() to see available endpoints.

- ##### Installing With Docker 🐳
  - Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker-Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) on your host environment (or PC).
  - Clone this [repository](https://github.com/krizten/Memoire-API) by running `git clone https://github.com/krizten/Memoire-API.git` in the terminal.
  - Open the [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml), then note the database name, host, port, username and password.
  - Create a .ENV file, using the [.env.example](.env.example) as a sample fill all the fields with correct data.
  - Start the application in development mode by running `docker-compose up`
